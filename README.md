# 1. Preface
This repository contains all information and server configurations for my own dedicated server.

I myself am not an expert in this area and<br>
use this documentation purely for documentation reasons for myself and all those who want to build this server.

I am very happy if you mark and mention me and this reposetory if needed.
This reposetory is inspired by @Redacks
