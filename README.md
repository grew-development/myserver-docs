# 1. Preface
This repository contains all information and server configurations for my own dedicated server.

I myself am not an expert in this area and<br>
use this documentation purely for documentation reasons for myself and all those who want to build this server.

I am very happy if you mark and mention me and this reposetory if needed.
This reposetory is inspired by [@Redacks](https://github.com/redacks)

If you have any optimization ideas or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

> This documentation is not suitable for all use cases and can therefore be adapted or modified according to your needs.
