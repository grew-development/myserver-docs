## 1. Downloading CT-Template
I used Debian Bullseye as the base template because Proxmox was already running on it and<br>
so you have the same operating system everywhere. To get the CT template, do the following.

* Go to `Local > CT Templates` in the Proxmox WebUI
* Click on the button `Templates`
* Choose and downloaded "Debian-11-Standard"
    * Decription: Debian 11 Bullseye (standard)
* Wait until it says “TASK OK” and close the window
